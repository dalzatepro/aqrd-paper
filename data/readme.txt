These files replicate the results reported in our paper “Foreign Aid, Human Rights and Democracy Promotion: Evidence from a Natural Experiment” and in the Supplemental Appendix. 

******* Files ***********

1. “Final_Main.dta” : data file used to replicate results in paper
2. “Replication_Main.do” : do file that replicates results in paper
3. “Final_Supplemental2.dta : data file used to replicate results in supplemental appendix
4. “Final_Supplemental.do” : do file that replicates results in supplemental appendix
5. “MergeFile.do” : do file that mergers all data files used in our analyses, both in the paper and the supplemental appendix
6 “master2.dta” : an interim datafile used to produce one of the analyses in the supplemental appendix

******* Replication Instructions ***************

1. The data file for the main analyses is named “Final_Main.dta” and for the supplemental analysis is “Final_Supplemental2.dta”

2. Descriptions of all the variables in both datasets are listed in “Codebook.pdf”. 

3. Replicating our results requires the use of both R and Stata.

4. To replicate our results, first save all of the replication files in the same folder. 

5. To replicate the tables and figures for the main analysis, run the do file “Replication_Main.” Code to reproduce the figure in R is given at the end of the do file. This needs to be run in R. To replicate the tables and figures for the supplemental analysis, run the do file “Final_Supplemental.” R code also appears at the end of the file and is clearly marked.
